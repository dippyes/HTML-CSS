Images:

By default, images are inline elements. For images to center properly, they must behave as block-level elements.

display: block;

he background-image can be set to a value of url().

1. url() - contains the URL of the image, enclosed in double quotes.

You can control how a background image repeats with the background-repeat property. This property can take one of four values:

    repeat - the default value — the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.
    repeat-x - the background image will be repeated only along the x-axis (horizontally).
    repeat-y - the background image will be repeated only along the y-axis (vertically).
    no-repeat - the background image will not be repeated at all and will appear only once.

When a background image is not repeated, its position can be modified with the background-position property. 
A background image is positioned using a 3 by 3 grid (three rows, three columns), meaning there are 9 total possible positions for the image:

    left top - top left corner of the element's box.
    center top - top center of the element's box.
    right top - top right corner of the element's box.
    left center - left column, center row.
    center center - the center of the element's box.
    right center - right column, center row.
    left bottom - bottom left corner of the element's box.
    center bottom - bottom center of the element's box.
    right bottom - bottom right corner of the element's box.
Note: When setting this property, if only one value is specified, the second value will default to center.

background can be used to set all the 3 properties mentioned above (background-image, background-repeat, background-position)

To modify a background image's size, you can use the background-size property.
1. cover - expands the image as large as possible to cover the full width or height of a container. If the dimensions of the container (say, a div) are larger than the dimensions of the image, the image will become distorted. This value is best for images that don't communicate important content to the user, like background images.
2. contain - expands the image as large as possible, but the image will be letterboxed, which means it won't cover the full width or height of a container.

background-attachment - specify whether or not a background image should remain at one position on the web page or whether it should move up and down as the user scrolls through a web page.

background-attachment take one of two values:


1. scroll - this value allows the image to move up and down as a user scrolls on the web page (this is the default value). 
2. fixed - this value pins the image's position on the page.

Gradient background
-webkit-linear-gradient() - this value accepts two arguments: the two colors the linear gradient will transition to and from. The colors are usually specified as hex color codes. 











You've learned how to add images to a web page using the <img> element and the background property. What's the difference between these two methods? When should one method be used over another?

The method used depends on the type of image.
Some images are part of the content of a web page (icons, logos, album photos, etc.) and they communicate important information to a user. Other images are intended simply to style a web page (header backgrounds, etc.), not to communicate important information.
When an image communicates important information, you can use the <img> element and style the image using CSS, if needed.
When an image is intended to style a web page, you can use the background property and further style it with CSS.

learned so far:
1. Image dimensions are set using the width and height properties. 
2. A background image can be added to any element using the background-image property. 
3. A background image's repetition is controlled with the background-repeat property. 
4. The position of a non-repeating image can be controlled using the background-position property. 
5. The background property is a shorthand way of setting an image, repetition, and it's position. 
6. The background-image also supports color gradients.
