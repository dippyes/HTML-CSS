box-model: borders
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 3px;
    border-color: rgb(22, 77, 100);
    
    border: 3px solid rgb(22,77,100) {width style, color}.

    border-radius: by setting it the same value as the height of the element we get a CIRCLE! :)
    
    


1.  You can style the borders of an element's box.
2.  The border-width property allows you to set the thickness, or width, of a border.
3.  The border-style property allows you to change the style of border used.
4.  The border-color property allows you to change the color of a border.
5.  Individually setting the style, thickness, and color of a border can bloat code. It's more efficient to use the shorthand border property and specify all three properties at once, in that order.
6.  Box borders don't have to be square. Their corners can be rounded with the border-radius property.
