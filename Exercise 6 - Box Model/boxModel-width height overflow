- Box Model: used for formatting the the website 
- Width/Height properties expressed in: Pixels, {Em, %} 
{} - relative dimensions
- min/max-width/height - setting up for different browser sizes.
- overflow {hidden, scroll}.

    1.All HTML elements are contained within a box.
    2.Boxes have two dimensions: a width and a height. These dimensions can be modified with the width and height properties.
    3.Width and height dimensions can be set using one of three units of measurement: pixels, ems, or percentages.
    4.A minimum and maximum width or height can be set for a box. This helps ensure that content remains legible when a user shrinks or expands their browser window.
    5.If an element's box becomes too small, the content may overflow. The overflowed content can be controlled with the overflow property.

INFO:
You probably noticed that we started this lesson by selecting all elements on the page with the universal selector, *. We also used a CSS property that we haven't yet covered: border. In the next lesson, you'll learn about box borders and how to manipulate them using CSS.
