  <p>At this stage I should be able to form a basic web page upon which there can be some graphic elements or ordered and unordered lists.</p>
  <p>Formatting those is yet to be shown on those tutorials. Also during my period of learning I am using <strong>GIT</strong> in order to track my development and be able to save and use on multiple locations those exercises.</p>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reminder and development of skills within HTML.</li>
    <li>Learning new tags that are used in the new standart.</li>
    <li>Development on stages.</li>
    <li>Learning how to show and thought peopple this knowledge.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>Some of the functionality cannot be tested (target=_blank), developer tools, firewall restrictions).</li>
    <li>Slow advancment, though this maybe good for the current stage.</li>
    <li>Not yet sematic HTML.</li>
  </ul>
